-- ============================================
-- ADD ALL FEATURES TO YOUR APP
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to get all features
-- ============================================

-- This will add all the tables needed for:
-- - Bookings
-- - Programs (tours/activities)
-- - Agents (travel agencies)
-- - Drivers
-- - Guides
-- - Invoices
-- - Reports
-- And much more!

-- Note: This is a simplified version. For full features,
-- run the individual migration files from supabase/migrations/ folder

-- For now, let's just run the main migration file
-- Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run the file:
-- combined-migrations.sql

-- OR run the migrations one by one starting with:
-- 001_initial_schema.sql
-- 002_rls_policies.sql
-- 003_seed_data.sql
-- etc.
